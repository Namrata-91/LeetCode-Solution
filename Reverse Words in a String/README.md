# Reverse Words in a String

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the __words.__

A __word__ is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The __words__ in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

__Example 1:__

__Input:__ s = "the sky is blue"

__Output:__ "blue is sky the"
