# Binary Search
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

__Example 1:__

__Input:__ nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9

__Output:__ 4

__Explanation:__ 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
