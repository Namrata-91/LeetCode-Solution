# Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. 
If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.


__Example 1:__

__Input:__ word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
__Output:__ "apbqcr"
__Explanation:__ The merged string will be merged as so:
__word1:__  a   b   c
__word2:__    p   q   r
__merged:__ a p b q c r
